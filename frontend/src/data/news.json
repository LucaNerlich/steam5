        "text": "<p>Each day, Steam5 randomly selects a <strong>bucket pick strategy</strong> that determines which review count ranges the games will come from. Here's how each strategy works:</p><ul><li><strong>RANDOM</strong>: Each bucket has an equal chance of being picked for each round.</li><li><strong>EQUAL</strong>: Picks are evenly distributed across all buckets (one per bucket when rounds match bucket count).</li><li><strong>LEAN_HIGH</strong>: Higher probability of picking games from buckets with more reviews.</li><li><strong>LEAN_LOW</strong>: Higher probability of picking games from buckets with fewer reviews.</li><li><strong>LEAN_CENTER</strong>: Higher probability of picking games from the middle bucket.</li><li><strong>HIGH</strong>: Multiple picks are reserved from the top two buckets (high review counts).</li><li><strong>LOW</strong>: Multiple picks are reserved from the bottom two buckets (low review counts).</li><li><strong>CENTER</strong>: Multiple picks are reserved from the center bucket.</li></ul><p>The strategy chosen each day is hidden, so you'll need to adapt your guessing strategy based on the games you see!</p>",
